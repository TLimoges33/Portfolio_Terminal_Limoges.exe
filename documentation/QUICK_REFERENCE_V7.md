## Talking Points

**Session Management:**
"I implemented session persistence using localStorage with an intelligent 50-command limit to prevent memory bloat. Users can also export full session transcripts with timestamps and metadata."

**Analytics:**
"Built command usage tracking with Google Analytics 4 integration. The stats command visualizes this data with ASCII bar charts, showing the top 10 most-used commands."

**Visualizations:**
"Created interactive demos of my SYN_OS kernel project - including an animated boot sequence, memory architecture visualization, and syscall overview. These make complex technical concepts accessible."

**Testing:**
"Expanded test coverage from 13 to 73 tests - that's a 461% increase. Includes comprehensive security testing for CSP, XSS prevention, input validation, and privilege escalation."

**Performance:**
"Implemented command result caching with 60-second TTL and optimized localStorage usage. The architecture is ready for future enhancements like lazy loading and Web Workers."

## Files Changed

- `js/main.js` - Added 800+ lines (session, analytics, demos, shortcuts, stats, easter eggs, caching)
- `js/data/commands.json` - Updated with new commands
- `tests/commands.test.js` - NEW: 25 tests for command functionality
- `tests/security.test.js` - NEW: 35 tests for security features
- `docs/V7_NEW_FEATURES.md` - NEW: Complete documentation
